## Hi there 👋

I'm Luka Kopač, a PhD student at University of Ljubljana, Biotechnical faculty, Department of wood science and technology (Slovenia).

- 🔭 The main topic of my PhD is **hyperspectral imaging of wood**, which enables the exploration and research of a wide range of material properties.
- 🌱 Besides research and study I’m currently working on creating a Python package that would simplify the HSI data handling.
  
- ⚡ So far I've been working on wood species discrimination based on NIR HSI, that would mostly benefit the heritage science field.
